<h1>rl-fivem-nui-wrapper</h1>

<p>A simple FiveM NUI Wrapper made with VanillaJS aiming faster development with lightweight tools and skipping the building step. It was designed to be SPA architecture (Single Page Application), but feel free to adapt it or add in issues whatever you want to see and I will be updating.</p>

<h2>Libraries:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>TailwindCSS for CSS Styling</li>
  <li>lucide.dev for icons</li>
  <li>google fonts for fonts (kekw)</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe we should download all the libraries to prevent delay</p>

<h2>Features:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>html/config.js file that allows you to add more pages to your NUI, set NUI callbacks from the browser side</li>
  <li>invokeNuiCallback(cbName, data) that will call any registered NUI Callback</li>
  <li>openNui(), closeNui() (only show/hide from the browser side, you must do SetNuiFocus on lua side too)</li>
  <li>comes with /rlnui-open and /rlnui-close for test purposes</li>
  <li>comes with a button in home page to invoke ping callback for test purposes</li>
</ul>

<h2>To Add:</h2>

  <li>add colors control in config.js (primary color, secondary color, text color, ...)</li>
</ul>
